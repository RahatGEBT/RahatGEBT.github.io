    Infographic Generation Plan:
    Narrative & Structure:
    1.  Hero/Intro: Hook with name, title, and core mission statement. Provide key links (LinkedIn, etc.).
    2.  About Me: Expand on the research vision and professional identity.
    3.  News/Recent Highlights: Showcase the most recent impactful publication.
    4.  Research Experience: Detail professional journey using a simpler, grid-based card layout.
    5.  Skills Showcase: Use attractive and colorful skill chips/badges for both Laboratory & Experimental and Computational & Bioinformatics sections with inline expand/collapse details.
    6.  Publications: Highlight top-tier publications first, then show a growth trend with a Line Chart (enhanced aesthetics, using citation data, gradient fill, and improved point styles). Remove IF and Q. A comprehensive, collapsible list of all publications is provided.
    7.  Leadership & Impact: Showcase non-research contributions (BioSol Centre) to demonstrate broader skills.
    8.  Contact/Footer: A clear call to action and final contact points, updated with all provided contact info and social links.
    
    Color Palette: Using a blend of "Brilliant Blues," "Energetic & Playful," and other vibrant options from the `colour combinations` image.
    - Main Blue (Primary Accent): #2563EB
    - Lighter Blue for backgrounds/accents: #DBEAFE, #BFDBFE
    - Green/Emerald: #047857 (text), #D1FAE5 (bg)
    - Indigo: #4338CA (text), #EEF2FF (bg)
    - Orange/Amber: #D97706 (text), #FEF3C7 (bg)
    - Pink/Rose: #BE185D (text), #FCE7F3 (bg)
    - Purple: #7C3AED (text), #EDE9FE (bg)
    - Text: #2D3748 (Dark Gray)
    - White: #FFFFFF
    
    Visualization Plan:
    - Data Point: Core Skill Categories (Lab, Computational, General) -> Goal: Compare -> Visualization: Colorful Skill Chips/Badges with inline modal descriptions -> Justification: Provides a direct and visually appealing representation of discrete skills, with on-demand detailed explanations integrated seamlessly. Method: HTML/CSS with Tailwind and JavaScript for toggle. NO SVG.
    - Data Point: Publication citation trends over years -> Goal: Change -> Visualization: Line Chart -> Justification: Clearly demonstrates research impact and growth over time. Using citation data provides a stronger metric. Enhanced with gradient fill and custom point styles. Method: Chart.js (Canvas). NO SVG.
    - Data Point: Career Progression -> Goal: Organize -> Visualization: Grid-based cards -> Justification: Organizes chronological experience in a clean, modern, and easy-to-follow format. Method: HTML/CSS with Tailwind. NO SVG.
    
    Confirmation: NEITHER Mermaid JS NOR SVG were used in this output. All visualizations are rendered via Chart.js to a Canvas element or constructed with styled HTML/CSS.

                    I'm a cancer biology researcher with a strong interest in breast cancer metastasis, particularly regarding how the bone microenvironment influences tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of targeted therapies that prevent metastatic relapse and enhance patient outcomes. I thrive in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments and am always open to connecting with researchers, clinicians, and innovators who share this vision.

                    Our latest research, "Bone-Induced HER2 Promotes Secondary Metastasis in HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer," demonstrates that blocking HER2-mediated secondary metastasis improves clinical outcome and establishes HER2 as a critical biomarker for bone metastasis in patients with initial HR+/HER2- breast cancer, representing ∼70% of all cases. This work, published in the high-impact journal *Cancer Discovery*, addresses an urgent need for alternative strategies to halt metastasis progression.

                description: 'Our groundbreaking study, published in Cancer Discovery, elucidates how the bone microenvironment promotes HER2 expression, driving secondary metastasis in HR+/HER2- breast cancer, which accounts for a significant portion of all breast cancer cases. We demonstrate that blocking HER2-mediated secondary metastasis significantly improves clinical outcomes in preclinical models. This research establishes HER2 as a crucial non-invasive biomarker for bone metastasis formation, identifiable through circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The findings provide compelling evidence for developing novel targeted therapies to prevent metastatic relapse and enhance patient survival. This work addresses a critical unmet need for alternative strategies to halt the progression of aggressive breast cancer by targeting the bone-mediated HER2 induction.',
